Provides a livefeed for the datastore (kind="comments") Pretty inefficient since google
	does not support local http triggers (yet). so ti runs a couple times per variable time.

################################

To run it,	
	1) Open a console at "~/Desktop/Projects/datastore_demo_comments_livefeed"
	2) Run the command "python livefeed.py"
	3) Enter "1" to give the prompt to start it.
	4) Interrupt the process by pressing "Crtl + C" (copy shortcut)
